# Cryptox (CTX)

## Overview  🪙

Cryptox (CTX) is a cryptocurrency based on the ERC20 standard. The maximum circulating supply is fixed to prevent inflation.

## Features 📃

* Maximum circulating supply - 1,000,000 CTX
* Mint - The owner of the contract can mint new tokens, with a maximum limit (100,000) and minimum (100) of tokens per transaction, in order to avoid abrupt manipulations that affect the price.
* Burn - The contract owner can burn tokens with a maximum limit (100,000) of tokens per transaction, in order to maintain a fixed maximum supply of circulating tokens.
* Multitransfer - Anyone can make multiple transfers, when it is required to send the same amount of tokens to 3 different addresses.
* Pause and unpause - The contract owner can pause transactions (mint, burn, multitransfer) in case of emergency, and later resume them.
